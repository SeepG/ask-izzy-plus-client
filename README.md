## About Ask Izzy Plus
### Project Background
**Description**
Ask Izzy Plus is a self-service web application built for our client Infoxchange. Service providers listed on Ask Izzy can log in and update contact 

A full stack developer needs to be able to demonstrate they can build a complete application from design through to deployment for a commercial client (using appropriate tools and methodologies).

* You are to design, build, deploy and present a web application (App) built for a real world customer.
* Find a business or organisation (preferably near your campus) to build an App for.
* Meet with the business owner or organisation manager to find out what challenges they face. Find a problem that you can solve with an App and present your ideas to the client.
* The project must be completed in the assigned groups.

**Technologies**
Demonstrate your full stack development skills by implementing the following requirements, At a minimum use the following technologies:
* Mongo / Mongoose
* Express
* React.js
* Node.js

### Functionality and Features
The goal of the Ask Izzy Plus project is to explore the needs of staff working in organisations that use Ask Izzy to find out what additional functionality would make it more useful to them. For example, this may include an Ask Izzy Dashboard that organisations can log in to, where they can:

**MVP**
- Editing or removing your site or service
- If you need to make changes to your service details, or remove your service from the Ask Izzy homelessness website and Infoxchange Service Seeker national directory, please click 'Update/remove service' on the individual service listing and provide all of the requested information. The changes you request will be actioned within seven (7) calendar days from submission.

**Extensions**
-	The ability to update their details and information on Ask Izzy easily.  
-	Create lists of ‘favourite’ services that they could share easily with their clients by hardcopy, SMS or email.

**Prototype**

As a prototype MVP it would be great to build out the Service Provider ability to:
* Login/Logout
* Create/Update/Amend their details

## The Brief
### The Client
**Infoxchange**

Infoxchange is an organisation that develops and supports innovative software for a wide range of purposes to help people who face disadvantage and the organisations that support them.

**Ask Izzy**

Infoxchange's mobile website Ask Izzy connects people at risk of or experiencing homelessness or disadvantage to over 360,000 services across Australia, including housing, a meal, support and counselling, and much more.
* Ask Izzy is a centralised directory that provides relevant, up to date information about services available to people who are experiencing or are at risk of homelessness and the people who support them.
* Ask Izzy is a comprehensive and easy to use resource for mobile, tablet and desktop. It’s a place for you and the people you support to find out about location based housing options, where to access meals, material aid and health services. There are also links to local services including: legal, financial, alcohol and other drugs, family violence and mental health.
* With more than 1.3 million searches on the site since it was first launched -  Ask Izzy connects close to 1000 people a day to help nearby.
* Help us keep Ask Izzy relevant. Up-to-date service information is vital. Organisations across the sector can contribute to this community led initiative to help us make it better. Your organisation can even add information about your temporary services to the program and events section.


Ask Izzy is an open source application and can be located on GitHub https://github.com/ask-izzy/ask-izzy.

### The Problem (Problem Definition)
**Need/Problem**
* Service providers need to be able to update their service
details
* Identified that service providers often rely on their person network.
* The process needs to be simplified for services providers to update their information
* Accuracy of services available are important to clients using these services

**Business Context**
* Infoxchange policy requires that direct contact be made with service providers prior to adding or updating their records. Such contact ensures compliance with privacy laws, confirms that changes were submitted by the service provider’s office and verifies the validity, accuracy and completeness of the information.
* Online updates submitted by service providers require procedures to ensure validity and accuracy. Updates submitted online are stored in a holding bay until they can be verified with the provider, checked for consistency and correct formatting, edited if necessary, and finally included in the directory.
* Experience confirms that self-authoring approaches, even those that are automated, are insufficient to maintain community service directories at an acceptable standard.
* Responses to auto-emails have increased as agencies become accustomed to the
procedure, but after a number of years, they still have a return rate of only forty to sixty per cent. Telephone contact has clearly proved itself the most effective updating method.

Infoxchange employs several updating methods:
* Scheduled bulk emails out to service listings
* Provision of self-response opportunities – via online forms
* Mail-outs
* Telephone contact
* Fax-backs.

**Solution/Outcome**
* Service providers want more control over their available services
* Accommodation providers want to update their availability/vacancy and be able to do this seamlessly
* Service providers would like to be able to save favourites lists
### The Solution (Purpose)
* MVP
* Traffic light system (for Vacancies)
* Login to update details
* Further details of the type of housing on Ask Izzy
* Ask Izzy tracks appointments for clients
* Alert sent to Ask Izzy if a SP update their details
